# Minsk-2 emulator with Minsk-22 support

## Description

The minsk emulator in this repository was originally developed by [Martin Mare≈°](https://github.com/gollux) in 2010.

This is a version modified by [Rutger van Bergen](https://github.com/rbergen). The main difference from the original version is that this one includes support for the Minsk-22, which is basically a version of the Minsk-2 with double the memory and additional I/O devices. As I/O device support in the emulator is very limited, only the difference in memory is relevant in this context.

## Build

1. Make sure you have make, GCC and common libraries installed. On Debian-based Linux distributions, this can be arranged by executing the following command:

   ```text
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y build-essential
   ```

2. Download (and, if applicable, extract) the emulator sources.

3. Issue the following command from the directory containing the emulator source files:

   ```text
   make
   ```

The emulator executable will be called `minsk` if the build succeeds.

## Use

The emulator reads its input from stdin. Loading and executing the ex-hello example program would therefore be done like this:

```text
./minsk < ex-hello
```

Any output written to the emulated printer will be directed to stdout, as is any tracing information.

The list of supported options can be acquired by running the emulator with any unsupported option:

```text
./minsk -h
```

## Documentation

Introductory documentation for the emulator can be found in the [readme.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rbergen/minsk/blob/master/readme.html) file.

The [INSTRUCTIONS](INSTRUCTIONS) file contains more technical information about the Minsk-2/Minsk-22, its instruction set and their implementation in the emulator.

## Original version
